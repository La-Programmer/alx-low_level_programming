INTERPOLATION SEARCH
The time complexity of interpolation is dependent on two things;
1. The array is sorted in ascending order
2. The uniformity of the array is high (i.e; The numerical distance between the elements of the array is uniform to some extent)

Interpolation formula; size_t pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (value - array[low]))

INPUTS: array, size, value
EXPECTED OUTPUT: First index where value is located

PROCESS;
Declare variables; pos, high, low.

While (array[pos] != value || high != low)
    pos = low + (((double)(high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (value - array[low]))
    printf("Value checked array[%d] = [%d]", pos, array[pos])
    if (array[pos] == value)
        return pos
    else if (array[pos] > value)
        high = pos - 1
    else
        low = pos + 1
return -1
